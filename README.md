# ccn-templates
Templates for CCN conference submissions

Descriptions of each one are in the files themselves - currently they exist for Rmarkdown, Latex and Word. Rmarkdown should probably be knitted in Rstudio!

The word and latex templates are just copied from www.ccneuro.org, originally written by Konrad Kording (I think).

Enjoy.
